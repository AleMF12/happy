# x is a variable and I use input to store the value in the variable x. I called the value Number1
x = input("number1 = ")
# y is a variable and I use input to store the value in the variable x. I called the value Number2
y = input("number2 = ")
# I compared two values x and y and I got the boolean answer. When x and y are equal it shows True otherwise false.
print(x == y)
